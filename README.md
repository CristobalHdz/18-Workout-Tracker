# Section 02: General Information

Create an application that when runned, `npm install` => `npm run seed` => `npm start` should redirect you to the local server 3001.
For this assignment, create a workout tracker. We have already been provided with the front end code.

The code can be pulled and follow the instructions above, or just visiting the Heroku App.

# Section 03: My experience

The backend connections were really easy to do with the help of the class' material that we got. A bunch of copy-paste and adapt to what the code wanted to do. The problem is that I though the front end was compeltely finished and that stopped me from making progress until I started searching there.

I still think that the `Heroku deployment` should be taught more in class. We should have dedicated a full class jsut to publish one page to ge tthe hang of it.
